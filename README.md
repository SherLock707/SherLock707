### 👋 Hi, I'm SherLock707

🔍 AI Engineer passionate about building real-world machine learning systems—from low-latency computer vision pipelines to cutting-edge GenAI applications.

---

🧠 I work at the intersection of ML infrastructure, agentic LLM systems, and simulation-driven evaluation. My projects often involve:  
- Deploying CV models with sensor fusion (e.g., ToF + vision)  
- Prototyping RAG-based recommendation systems using LLMs and vector databases  
- Simulating complex environments to stress-test AI pipelines  
- Building tools for scraping, upscaling, and visual fidelity in GenAI workflows  

💡 You'll find a mix of experimental repos, personal utilities, and open-source work related to ML, vision, automation, and local AI tools.

🚀 Always exploring how to push intelligent systems from prototype to production.  
🛠️ Tinkering with LangChain, Diffusers, LLaMA-family models, ONNX/TensorRT, and more.  
🌍 Advocating for accessible, local-first AI solutions.

🖥️ Outside of AI, I’m into Linux customization and ricing—crafting a sleek, efficient desktop environment that reflects my personal style and workflow.
